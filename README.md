# FriendFinder

This full-stack site is a compatibility-based “Friend Finder” Application.  This full-stack app takes results from users surveys and then compares their answers with those from other users.  The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

Created during Week 13 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The goal was to create a Friend Finder app (essentially a dating app but for friends) using Node and Express servers. The user enters the page that leads to a survey. When the user submits the survey, they are matched with a "friend" that has the closest match to their personality.
